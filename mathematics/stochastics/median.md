# Definition
- The [[median]] is the center of the total [[probability]] of a [[distribution]]
- $m$ pf the [[random variable]] $X$ is a [[median]] if $P(X \leq m) \geq \frac{1}{2} \leq P(X \geq m)$ 
# existance
- every [[distribution]] has at least one [[median]]
- a [[distribution]] can have a [[set]] of [[median|medians]]
# relationship to the [[quantile function]]
- the [[quantile function]] $F_X^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$ is allways a [[median]]
- if $X$ has a [[set]] of [[median|medians]] $M$ $F_X^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = inf(M)$
# relationship to the [[mean absolute error]]
- the [[median]] is the optimum of the [[mean absolute error]]
# difference to the [[mean]]
- while the [[median]] is the center of the total probability the [[mean]] is the center of
