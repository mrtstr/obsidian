- [[statistical estimator]] for relative prediction error 
- relative quality of a statistical model given a collection of statistical models
- estimates the amount if information lost with the model

ACI = 2k -2\ln\left(\max L(\theta)\right)
$$
- $k$ is the number of estimated parameters
- $L$ is the [[likelihood function]]
