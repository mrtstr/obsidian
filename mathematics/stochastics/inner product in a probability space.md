### [[inner product]] in a [[probability space]]
the following is an [[inner product]] in a [[probability space]]

$$
\langle X, Y \rangle = \mathbb{E}[XY] = \int_{\Omega} xy f_{XY}(x,y) \mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y
$$
- its easy to see that $\mathbb{E}[XY]$ is [[linear map|linear]] [[symmetric]], and [[positive definite]]

### [[norm]] in a [[probability space]]
- since every [[inner product]] induces a [[norm]] ([[inner products and norms]])
- the following is a [[norm]]

$$
||X||= \sqrt{\mathbb{E}[X^2]}
$$

### [[metric]] in a [[probability space]]
- since every [[norm]] induces a [[metric]] ([[relationship norm and metric]])
- the following is a [[metric]]

$$
d(X, Y) = ||X - Y||= \sqrt{\mathbb{E}[(X- Y)^2]}
$$
