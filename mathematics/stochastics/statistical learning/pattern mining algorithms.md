Pattern mining algorithms are a type of data mining technique that are used to identify patterns and relationships within a dataset. These algorithms can be used for a variety of purposes, such as identifying customer buying patterns in a retail context, understanding common user behaviour sequences for a website/app, or finding relationships between different variables in a scientific study.

Pattern mining algorithms typically work by analyzing large datasets and looking for repeated patterns or associations between variables. Once these patterns have been identified, they can be used to make predictions about future trends or outcomes or to understand the underlying relationships within the data.

## Algorithms

-   **Apriori algorithm**: an algorithm for finding frequent item sets in a transactional database — it’s efficient and widely used for association rule mining tasks.
-   **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: a type of neural network that is designed to process sequential data as they are able to capture temporal dependencies in the data.
-   **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: a type of recurrent neural network that is designed to remember information for longer periods of time. LSTMs are able to capture longer-term dependencies in the data and are often used for tasks such as language translation and language generation.
-   **Sequential Pattern Discovery Using Equivalence Class (SPADE)**: a method for finding frequent patterns in sequential data by grouping together items that are equivalent in some sense. This method is able to handle large datasets and is relatively efficient, but may not work well with sparse data.
-   **PrefixSpan**: an algorithm for finding frequent patterns in sequential data by constructing a prefix tree and pruning infrequent items. PrefixScan is able to handle large datasets and is relatively efficient, but may not work well with sparse data.
