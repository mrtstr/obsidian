# sampling from a [[probability density function (PDF)|distribution]]
(Pseudo) random samples can be generated by generating a pseudo random sample from a simple distribution like the [[continous uniform distribution]] $U(0,1)$ and transforming the sample to be of a more complex distribution.
## transformation methods
