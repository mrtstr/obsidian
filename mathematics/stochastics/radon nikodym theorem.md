### radon nikodym theorem
- given two [[probability measure]] $\nu$ and $\lambda$ on the same [[measurable space]] $(\Omega, \mathcal{A})$ 
- $\nu$ is absolute continuous to $\lambda$ which means $\lambda(A) = 0 \Rightarrow \nu(A) = 0$
- this means that $\nu$ is just a scaled version of $\lambda$ and there exists a function $f=\frac{d\nu}{d\lambda}$ that compensates for that

$$
\begin{split}
\mathbb{\nu}(A) 
&= \int_\Omega \mathbb{I}[\omega \in A] d\nu \\
&= \int_A  d\nu \\

&= \int_A \frac{d\nu}{d\lambda} d\lambda \\
\end{split}
$$

- How much more (or less) weight does ν\nuν give to each point, compared to μ\muμ?
