## Multiplication Rule for [[event|Events]] for Distributions

Given [[random experiment]] with $k$ different parts with $n_1, ..., n_k$ outcomes. The [[cardinality]] of the [[sample space]] is given by the product of the outcomes of the parts

$$
|\Omega| = \prod\limits_{i=1}^k n_i
$$
## [[multiplication rule]] for [[PDF]]

$$
f_{XY}(x,y) =f_{X\mid Y}(x \mid y) \cdot f_Y(y)
$$
When $X$ and $Y$ are independent $f_{X\mid Y}(x \mid y) = f_{X}(x)$ and we get the following:
$$
f_{XY}(x,y) =f_{X}(x) \cdot f_Y(y)
