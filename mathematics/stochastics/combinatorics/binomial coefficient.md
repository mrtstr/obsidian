## Definition
The [[binomial coefficient]] is defined as follows:
$$
\begin{split}
{n \choose k}
&= \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\
&= C_{n,k} \\
&= \frac{P_{n,k}}{k!} \\
\end{split}
$$
- it is equal to the number of [[combinations]] of $n$ taken $k$
- it is equal to the number of [[permutations]] divided by $k!$

## Properties [[binomial coefficient]]
1) $n$ over $0$ and $n$ over $n$ are equal to one because only the empty set / the original set of $n$ elements satisfy the condition
$${n \choose 0} = {n \choose n} = 1$$
2) 
$$
{n \choose k} = {n \choose {n-k}}
$$
proof:
$$
{n \choose n-k}
= \frac{n!}{n-k!(n-(n-k))!}
= \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
= {n \choose k}
