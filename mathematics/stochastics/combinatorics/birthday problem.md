- given a room with $k$ people: what is the probability that at least two of them have birthday on the same day
$$
\frac{P_{365,k}}{365^k} = \frac{365!}{(365-k)! 365^k}
$$
## interpretation 1
- for the first birthday there are 365 possibilities that satisfy the condition
- for the next birthday there are 364 valid possibilities and so on
- this is equal the the definition of the [[permutations]]

## interpretation 2
- given 365 days a [[permutations]] are the number of ordered subgroups and ordering implies that no two persons can have birthday at the same day
