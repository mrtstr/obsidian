The [[factorial|factorials]] of large numbers can be approximated using the [[sterling number]] 
## Definition
$$
\begin{split}
0! & =  1 \\
n! &=  \prod\limits^{n}_{k=1} k \\
&= n \cdot (n-1)!
\end{split}
$$
## Complexity
$$
\mathcal{O}(k^n) \subseteq \mathcal{O}(n!) \subseteq \mathcal{O}(n^n)
$$

## Applications
1) [[binomial coefficient]]
2) number of [[permutations]]
3) [[sterling number]]

## Number of arrangements in a [[set]]
Given a [[set]] with a [[cardinality]] of $n$. There are $n!$ different orders possible.

Number of arrangements in a [[set]]
Given a [[set]] with a [[cardinality]] of $n$. 
how many different orders are possible?

Suppose that three runners from team A and three runners from team B participate in a race. If all six runners have equal ability and there are no ties, what is the probability that the three runners from team A will finish first, second, and third, and the three runners from team B will finish fourth, fifth, and sixth?
Back: 
[[simple sample space]]:
$6!$ total arrangements and $3!\cdot3!$ satisfy the condition.
$$
\frac{6!}{3!3!}=\frac{1}{20}
