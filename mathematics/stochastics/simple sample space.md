# Definition
A [[simple sample space]] is a [[sample space]] with finite [[cardinality]] and all elements having the same [[probability]].
1) $|\Omega| < \infty$ 
2) $\forall \omega_i \neq \omega_j \in \Omega: \: P(\omega_i) = P(\omega_j)$

# Probability in a [[simple sample space]]
The [[probability]] of an [[event]] $A$ can be calculated by defining the [[cardinality]] of $A$ by the [[cardinality]] of the [[simple sample space]] $\Omega$. The [[probability]] in a [[simple sample space]] can be calculated using [[combinatorial methods]].
$$
P(A) = \frac{\left| A \right|}{\left| \Omega \right|}
$$
