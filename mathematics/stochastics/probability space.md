- Provides a formal model of a [[random process]]
- consists of three elements:
1) [[sample space]] $\Omega$
	- all possible outcomes
	- all values a [[discrete random variable]] can take
	- e.g. for a dice throw $\Omega = \left\{1,2,3,4,5,6\right\}$
	- can be [[countable]] (in a discrete [[probability space]]) or [[countable|non-countable]] (in a continuous [[probability space]])
2) [[event space]] $\mathcal{F}$ 
	- set all possible event's
	- event = set of outcomes $\in \Omega$ that satisfy a condition
	- $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{P}(\Omega) = \{A \mid A \subseteq \Omega \}$ ([[power set]] of the [[sample space]])
	- e.g. for a dice throw: a set of numbers between 1 and 6
3) [[probability measure]] $P$
	- assigns each event in the event space a probability $\in [1, 0]$ 
	- $P: \mathcal{F} \mapsto [0,1]$ 
	- e.g. for a dice throw: $P(\Omega = \left\{2,4,6\right\}) = \frac{1}{2}$
