-   **Prophet time series modelling**: A time series forecasting algorithm developed by Facebook that is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Some of its key strengths include handling missing data and trend changes, being robust to outliers, and being fast to fit.
-   **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)**: A statistical method for forecasting time series data that models the correlation between the data and its lagged values. ARIMA can handle a wide range of time series data but can be more difficult to implement than some other methods.
-   **Exponential smoothing**: a method for forecasting time series data that uses a weighted average of past data to make predictions. Exponential smoothing is relatively simple to implement and can be used with a wide range of data, but may not perform as well as more sophisticated methods.
