- A [[time series]] is a [[stochastic process]]
- series of indexed and ordered data points

### time series analysis 
- comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data
- only about the relationship between the past of the time series to its future and not about the relationship between different time series

### time series forecasting 
- is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values

### difference to normal [[statistical predictor]]
- normal [[statistical predictor]] interpolates a value from inside the range of its training data
- time series foreacsting is about extrapolation values $(S_{t+1},..., S_{t+m})$ from outside the range of its training data $(S_{t-n},..., S_{t})$
