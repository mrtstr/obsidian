### time series
- family of [[random variable]] $(x_t, t \in Z)$ on a [[probability space]] $(\Omega, \mathcal{X}, P)$ 
- often obervations are taken at descrete points in time $t$ over a fixed time period of length $T$: $X_1, ..., X_n$  
- in most cases the obervations at different points in time (e.g. $X_{t_1}$ and $X_{t_2}$) are not independent
