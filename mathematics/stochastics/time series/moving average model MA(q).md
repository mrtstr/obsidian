## definition [[moving average model MA(q)]]

- the [[moving average model MA(q)]] of order $p$  assumes 
- assumes [[stationary process|weakly stationary]]

![[stationary process#Definition (weakly) stationary process]]

- [[stochastic process]] $\{X_t\}$  
- white noise $\epsilon$ with $\mathbb{E}[\epsilon] =0$ and [[stochastic independent]] of $X_t$
- mean of the timeseries $\mu$
$$
X_t = \mu +  \epsilon_t  + \sum_{i=1}^p \theta_i X_{t-i} 
$$
