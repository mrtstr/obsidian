### linear programm
- [[constraint optimization problem]] with a [[linear map|linear]] objective function and [[linear map|linear]] contraint functions
- every [[linear map]] is [[convex]] thus every [[local minimum]] is a [[minimum|global minimum]] and 
$$
\begin{split}
\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^m}& \quad  c^\top x \\
\mathrm{s.t.} \: &Ax \geq b \\
\end{split}
$$

- note: equallity constraints can be expressed as two inequallity constraints
