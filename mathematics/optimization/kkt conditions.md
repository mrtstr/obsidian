### kkt conditions
- provide an alternative nesseary optimality condition for [[constraint optimization problem]] that does not rely on the [[linearized cone]]
- if $x^*$ is a [[local minimum]] and a [[constraint qualification]] holds in $x^*$
- then there exists lagrange multipliers $\lambda^* \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mu^* \in \mathbb{R}^k$ that satisfy the [[kkt conditions]]
