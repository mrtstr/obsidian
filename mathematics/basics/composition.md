### composition
- given two [[function|functions]] $f:A \rightarrow B$ and $g:B \rightarrow C$ then the [[composition]] $g \circ f: A \rightarrow C$ is defined as follows
$$
g \circ f (x) = f\left(g(x)\right)
$$
- the [[composition]] only exists when the codomain of $f$ is a subset of the domain of $g$
