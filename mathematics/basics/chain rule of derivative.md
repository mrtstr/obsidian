### chain rule

$$
\frac{df\left(g(x)\right)}{dx} = \frac{df\left(g(x)\right)}{dg(x} \cdot \frac{dg(x)}{dx} 
$$
#### intuition:
- the rate of change of $f$ to $x$ is equal to the rate of change of $f$ to $g$ times the rate of change of $g$ to $x$
- if a car is $5$ times faster than a bike and a bike is 4 times faster than a wakling person than the car is $20 = 4 	\times 5$ faster than a waling person

$$
\frac{\Delta \text{car distance}}{\Delta \text{time}} = \frac{\Delta \text{car distance}}{\Delta \text{bike distance}} \times \frac{\Delta \text{bike distance}}{\Delta \text{time}}

### definition derivative
$$
\frac{df(x)}{dx} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
