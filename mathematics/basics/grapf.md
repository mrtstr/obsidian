### grapf of a [[function]]
- the grapf of a [[function]] is defined as a [[set]] of [[n tuple|pairs]] of elements from the domain with treir images
$$
\begin{split}
graph(f) 
&= f(A) \\
&= \{(a,b): a \in A, b=f(a) \in im(f) \subseteq B\} \\
\end{split}
$$
- the [[cardinality]] of the graph of a [[function]] is equal to the [[cardinality]] of its domain
$$
\begin{split}
|graph(f)| = |A| 
\end{split}
$$
