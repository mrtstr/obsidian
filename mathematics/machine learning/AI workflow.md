### AI workflow
- static, predefined sequence of steps involving [[LLM]]
- can have decisions but not loops controlled by the system
- no persistent state

Basic
what differentiates an [[AI workflow]] from an [[AI agents]]? (4)

Back: 
• **Iterative**: execution repeats until termination
• **Stateful**: decisions depend on history
• **Adaptive**: behavior changes based on outcomes
• **Non-deterministic**: execution path not fixed in advance
### AI workflow
- static, predefined sequence of steps involving [[LLM]]
- can have decisions but not loops controlled by the system
- no persistent state

## AI agents
- system that interacts with [[LLM]] that have
	- a control loop
	- state, actions, feedback
	- goal directed multi-step behavior
