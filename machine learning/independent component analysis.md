### independent component analysis
- we assume that there exists a [[latent variable]] $Z \sim P_Z \in \mathbb{R}^r$ with [[stochastic independent]] components such that

$$
p_Z(z_1, ..., z_r) = \prod^r_{i=1} p_{Z_i}(z_i)
$$

- The **observed variable** $X \in \mathbb{R}^r$ s generated by a **linear mixing** process via an **unknown invertible mixing matrix** $M \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times r}$

$$
X=MZ
$$

- The goal of [[independent component analysis]] is to **recover the independent components** $Z$ from the observed data $X$ , by learning a **(linear) unmixing matrix** $N \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times r}$ 

$$
\tilde{Z}=NX = NMZ
$$

we make the following assumptions
