[[numpy]] [[np array]] [[pd series]]
## single operand operations
- works with all [[np universal function|universal numpy functions]] ([[numpy]] functions with only one operand) 

## multi operand operations
- some [[numpy]] functions with multiple operands and also supported
- before performing the operation the [[pd index]] with be automatically aligned 
- As usual, the union of the two indices is taken, and non-overlapping values are filled with missing values.
