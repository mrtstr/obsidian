## concept
- library providing columnar data structures for_in-memory computing
- can handle large datasets by partitioning of data in smaller chunks
- base data representation of [[polars]] and [[pandas]] 2.0
- Arrow can be used with [[parquet]], [[pandas]], [[polars]], [[pyspark]]

## data types
[[pa array]]: one dimentional data collection of the same [[pa datatype]]
[[pa table]]: named collection of [[pa array|pa arrays]] of the same lenth
[[pa dataset]]: partitioned table saved on the disc that can be loaded and manipulated chunk by chunk
