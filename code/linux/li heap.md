## [[li heap]]
- segment inside the [[li process image]] in the [[li virtual memory]] space of a [[li process]]
- [[li memory]] for dynamic memory storage for large data structures and objects with dynamic lifetimes'
- memory can be allocated or deallocated manuelly during the program execution during the processes liefetime

Back: 
- segment inside the [[li process image]] in the [[li virtual memory]] space of a [[li process]]
- [[li memory]] for dynamic memory storage for large data structures and objects with dynamic lifetimes'
- memory can be allocated or deallocated manuelly during the program execution during the processes liefetime

### [[li process image|process image summary]]
- a [[li process]] has its own [[li virtual memory]] space
- the [[li virtual memory]] space consists of 4 parts
	- [[li stack]]: for local (in scope) variables 
	- [[li heap]]: for manuel dynamicly allocated and deleted data
	- [[li data segment]]: for static/global variables that are 
	- [[li code segment]]: for the binary code that is executed ([[li program counter]] of each [[li thread]] keeping track of the location)
