Signals are one of the oldest inter-process communication methods used by Unix
They are used to signal asynchronous events to one or more processes

A signal could be generated by a keyboard interrupt or an error condition such as the process attempting to access a non-existent location in its virtual memory

Signals are also used by the shells to signal job control commands to their child processes.



Processes can choose to ignore most of the signals that are generated

with two notable exceptions: neither the SIGSTOP signal which causes a process to halt its execution nor the SIGKILL signal which causes a process to exit can be ignored


Not every process in the system can send signals to every other process, the kernel can and super users can. Normal processes can only send signals to processes with the same _uid_ and _gid_ or to processes in the same process grou


Signals are generated by setting the appropriate bit in the task_struct's signal field
word size of 32 bits can have 32 signals whereas 64 bit processors like the Alpha AXP may have up to 64 signals


Signals are not presented to the process immediately they are generated., they must wait until the process is running again. Every time a process exits from a system call its signal and blocked fields are checked and, if there are any unblocked signals, they can now be delivered. This might seem a very unreliable method but every process in the system is making system calls, for example to write a character to the terminal, all of the time. Processes can elect to wait for signals if they wish, they are suspended in state Interruptible until a signal is presented.
