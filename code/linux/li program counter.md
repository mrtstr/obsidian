## program counter
- Contains the [[li virtual memory]] address of the instruction in the [[li code segment]] that's currently executing
- each [[li thread]] has its own [[li program counter]] pointing to different adresses in the shared [[li code segment]] (of the [[li process]])

### [[li code segment|code segment]]
- segment inside the [[li virtual memory]] space of a [[li process]]
- contains executable binary code (mapped from the [[li disc]] to the [[li virtual memory]] of the [[li process]])
