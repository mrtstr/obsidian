- [[pd manipulations alsong axis]] on [[pd dataframe]] and [[pd series]] or a [[pd DataFrameGroupBy]] that includes the context of the row / column
- does not have any restrictions regarding the output shape
	- mapping `vector -> vector`
- can be used for the transform and/or combine step in a [[pd split transform combine]] operation because it does not have restrictions regarding the output shape
- more powerful than [[pd transform]] ([[pd transform]]: same output shape as input shape)
