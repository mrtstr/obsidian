## Protocol of lecture EE Ethics I Overview
### Why is it important to deal with ethics?
- Clarify and justify moral understanding
- reflect understanding and justify the reasons for the norms of society
→ give orientation in private and public life
- played a role in philosophy, in the everyday life and other disciplines like theology
### categorization
- different authors are using the therms like ethic and morality differently →precise definition is necessary
- broad definition of ethics used in this lecture: 
	1) name of a theoretical approach 
	2) human behavior that have components that are ethically relevant
- narrow definition of moral philosophy: name of specific theoretical approach with morality being the object of that approach
- differentiation between ethics in 
	1) general (normative ethics and methdaethics)
	2) applied ethics (for example applied in business), more practical → applied ethical principles to specific situations
### normative ethics: more systematic
- which actions are ethically permissible and impermissible in a given situation and why
- systematic approach to ethical judgement
- Example: Socrates discussed from an ethical point of view if he should evade from prison
- major approaches of normative ethics: 
	1) Deontology (Kant) 
	2) Consequentialism (Bentham, John Stuart Mill)
	3) Virtue Ethics (Aristotle)
### metaethics: basic questions
- what do things like right or wrong mean
- justification of ethical judgments
- fundamental of normative ethics
- can challenge the existence of normative ethics

### Metaethical Challenge to normative ethics
- claims that this impossible to justify ethical statements and convictions → normative ethics is doomed to fail and can't be right or wrong
- basic idea: ethical statements only express subjective attitudes
- braugt forward by ethical non cognitivists (Alfred J. Ayer, Charles L. Stevenson, Richard M. Hare)
- armament similar to aesthetical non-cognitivists
- example: "You were wrong when you stole money": first part is verifiable (did he take the money?) but the second part (was he right?) is purely subjective
- counter arguments
	1) Ethical statements can serve more than one function: in particular ethical statements can serve more than just the subjective attitude of the person saying it
	2) in everyday life it is taken for granted that ethical statements can be justified, so there seems to be some level of consensus about right of wrong of ethical statements

### example of aesthetical non-cognitivism
two scenarios:
- person A claims that a given room has tree windows while person B claims that it doesn't have three windows
- person A claims that a picture is nice while person B claims that it is not nice
first example: easy to verify who is right and who is right/wrong
second example: more difficult objectively verify if a picture has the property "nice"
position of aesthetical non-cognitivists: it's not possible to verify that because nice is only expressing the subjective attitude of a person → statements of example 2 are not right or wrong
