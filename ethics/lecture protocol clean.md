## 1. Introduction: Why is it important to deal with ethics?

At the beginning of the lecture, we discussed why we actually need to do this topic. It is not only for philosophy students but also for us. The main point is to clarify and justify our moral understanding. We have many norms in the society, but often we do not know the reasons for them. So ethics helps to reflect this understanding and find the reasons.

The goal is to give an **orientation**. This orientation is needed in the private life but also in the public life.

Historically, this topic played always a big role. It was important in philosophy, but also in the everyday life of people and other disciplines like theology.

## 2. Categorization and Definitions

The professor explained that there is a problem with the words. Different authors are using the therms like "ethic" and "morality" very differently. So we need a precise definition for this lecture so we are not confused.

**Broad definition of ethics** (used in this lecture):
1. It is the name of a theoretical approach.
2. It describes human behavior that have components that are ethically relevant.

There is also a **narrow definition**. Here, moral philosophy is the name of a specific theoretical approach, and morality is just the object of that approach.

We also made a differentiation between two types of ethics:
- **General Ethics:** This includes Normative Ethics and Metaethics.
- **Applied Ethics:** This is more practical. It is for example applied in business. Here we apply the ethical principles to specific situations to find a solution.

## 3. Normative Ethics
This part is the more systematic part. The main question here is: _Which actions are ethically permissible and which are impermissible in a given situation?_ And more important: _Why?_

It is a systematic approach to ethical judgement. We do not just say "this is wrong" but we try to find a system.

**Example discussed:** We talked about **Socrates**. He was in a difficult situation and discussed from an ethical point of view if he should evade from prison or stay. He did not just act on feeling, but he analyzed it.

**Major approaches of normative ethics:** The professor mentioned three main schools that we will learn later:
1. **Deontology:** Famous author is Immanuel Kant.
2. **Consequentialism:** Famous authors are Bentham and John Stuart Mill.
3. **Virtue Ethics:** This goes back to Aristotle.
## 4. Metaethics
Metaethics is dealing with the basic questions. It is not about _what_ is right, but _what it means_ when we say something is right or wrong.
- It asks for the meaning of terms like "right" or "wrong".
- It asks for the **justification** of ethical judgments.
This is the fundamental of normative ethics. But it is also dangerous because it can challenge the existence of normative ethics.
## 5. The Metaethical Challenge

There is a big challenge to normative ethics. This challenge claims that it is actually **impossible to justify ethical statements**. If this is true, then normative ethics is doomed to fail. It can not be right or wrong.

**The basic idea:** Ethical statements are not facts. They only express **subjective attitudes**. This theory is brought forward by the **ethical non-cognitivists**. Important names here are Alfred J. Ayer, Charles L. Stevenson, and Richard M. Hare. Their argumentation is very similar to the aesthetical non-cognitivists (about art and beauty).
**Example:** Someone says: _"You were wrong when you stole money."_ We can split this sentence in two parts:
1. "You stole money" -> This is verifiable. Did he take it? Yes or no.
2. "You were wrong" -> This part is not verifiable. The non-cognitivists say this is purely subjective. It is just an emotion of the speaker.

**Counter arguments mentioned in lecture:**
1. Ethical statements can serve more than one function. They are not only expressing the subjective attitude of the person saying it.
2. In our everyday life, we take it for granted that ethical statements can be justified. There seems to be a level of **consensus** about right or wrong. If it was only subjective, we could never agree.
### Excursus: Example of Aesthetical Non-Cognitivism

To understand the problem better, we looked at two scenarios comparing facts with aesthetics.

**Scenario 1:** Person A claims that a given room has three windows. Person B claims that it doesn't have three windows. _Result:_ This is easy to verify. We just count the windows. One person is right, the other is right/wrong.

**Scenario 2:** Person A claims that a picture is nice. Person B claims that it is not nice. _Result:_ This is much more difficult. Can we objectively verify if a picture has the property "nice"? The position of aesthetical non-cognitivists is: **No**. It is not possible to verify. The word "nice" is only expressing the subjective attitude of the person. So the statements in example 2 are not really right or wrong, they are just tastes.

The ethical non-cognitivists say that morality is exactly like Scenario 2.
