-   [**Euclidean Distance**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd16LVt5ct4&t=90s): a measure of the straight-line distance between two points in a Euclidean space. Euclidean distance is simple to calculate and is widely used in machine learning, but may not be the best choice in situations where the data is not uniformly distributed.
-   [**Cosine Similarity**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd16LVt5ct4): a measure of similarity between two vectors based on the angle between them.
-   [**Levenshtein Algorithm**](https://medium.com/@appaloosastore/string-similarity-algorithms-compared-3f7b4d12f0ff): an algorithm for measuring the distance between two strings, based on the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one string into the other. The Levenshtein algorithm is commonly used for spell-checking and string matching tasks.
-   [**Jaro-Winkler Algorithm**](https://medium.com/@appaloosastore/string-similarity-algorithms-compared-3f7b4d12f0ff): an algorithm for measuring the similarity between two strings, based on the number of matching characters and the number of transpositions. It’s similar to the Levenshtein algorithm and is often used for record linkage and entity resolution tasks.
-   [**Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5mlg91as1c&t=34s): a matrix decomposition method that decomposes a matrix into a product of three matrices — it’s an integral component for state-of-the-art recommendation systems.
