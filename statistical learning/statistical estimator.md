- Goal: find connect between input/features $x$ and output/labels $y$
- because the [[joint distribution]] $f_{XY}(x,y)$ is hard to find the goal is to approximate [[conditional distribution]]  $f_{X|Y}(x|y)$
- every point in the feature space $x$ is a distribution of outputs $y$
- goal: approimate estimator $f(x)$
