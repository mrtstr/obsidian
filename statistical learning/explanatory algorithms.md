-   **Linear/Logistic Regression**: a statistical method for modeling the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables — can be used to understand the relationships between variables based on the t-tests and coefficients.
-   **Decision Trees**: a type of machine learning algorithm that creates a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. They are useful for understanding the relationships between variables by looking at the rules that split the branches.
-   **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: a dimensionality reduction technique that projects the data onto a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much variance as possible. PCA can be used to simplify the data or to determine feature importance.
-   **Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME)**: an algorithm that explains the predictions of any machine learning model by approximating the model locally around the prediction by constructing a simpler model using techniques such as linear regression or decision trees.
-   **Shapley Additive explanations (SHAPLEY)**: an algorithm that explains the predictions of any machine learning model by computing the contribution of each feature to the prediction using a method based on the concept of “marginal contribution.”. It can be more accurate than SHAP in some cases.
-   **Shapley Approximation (SHAP)**: a method for explaining the predictions of any machine learning model by estimating the importance of each feature in the prediction. SHAP uses a method called the “coalitional game” method to approximate Shapley values and is generally faster than SHAPLEY.
