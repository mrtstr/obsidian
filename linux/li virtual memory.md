## [[li virtual memory]]
- abstraction layer between the [[li process]] and the [[li physical memory (RAM)]] and [[li disc]]
- from the [[li process]] perspective it is like having its own very lage private contious [[li memory]] space 
- in the [[li memory management unit]] of the [[li kernel]] a mapping of [[li physical memory (RAM)]] and [[li disc]] [[li memory paging|pages]] to [[li virtual memory]] [[li memory paging|pages]] is done (see [[li memory paging]])
