### AWS users
AWS users are principals (persons or apps) with their own _usernames and passwords_ to allow access to the AWS console.


### Federated identities
These are users managed outside of AWS. Identity providers(IdP) can be used to grant these users access to use AWS resources without having to create users within the AWS account.
