# [[routing]]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing

- hop-by-hop routing, each routing table lists, for all reachable destinations
- he simple algorithm of relaying [packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_(information_technology) "Packet (information technology)") to their destination's next hop thus suffices to deliver data anywhere in a network. Hop-by-hop is the fundamental characteristic of the IP [Internet layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_layer "Internet layer")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table#cite_note-1) and the OSI [Network Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Layer "Network Layer").
