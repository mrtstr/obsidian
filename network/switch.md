## switch
- device [[ip network|networking]] that multiplexes data packages to devices (destination node or other [[switch]]) within a [[ip network|network]]
- works on the [[network layers#data link layer|data link layer]] based on [[media access code (MAC)]] or on the [[network layers#network layer|network layer]] mased on the [[internet protocol (IP)]] adress
- [[router|routers]] usually have swiches included thus they have multiple [[ethernet]] ports thus no dedicated swich is needed in a home network

Basic
difference between [[router]] and [[switch]]
- what are they doing
- [[network layers]]
- when is it needed

Back: 
[[switch]] are multiplexing packages within a network while routers distribute packages accross networks

## switch
- device [[ip network|networking]] that multiplexes data packages to devices (destination node or other [[switch]]) within a [[ip network|network]]
- works on the [[network layers#data link layer|data link layer]] based on [[media access code (MAC)]] or on the [[network layers#network layer|network layer]] mased on the [[internet protocol (IP)]] adress

## router
- A [[ip network|networking]] device that connects multiple [[ip network|networks]] together and forwards data packets between them
	→ selecting paths for data packets to cross [[ip network|networks]] 
- if the destination of a package is within another [[subnetwork]] the router will send it to the [[router]] of the desination [[subnetwork]]
- within the network [[switch|swiches]] are used to distribute the packages (most [[router|routers]] have swiches included and thus have multiple [[ethernet]] ports)
- works on the [[network layers|network layer]] using the [[internet protocol (IP)]] adress
