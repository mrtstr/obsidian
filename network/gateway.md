## gateway
- network device that traslates from one [[network|network]] protocol to another
- on the [[osi layers#data link layer|data link layer]]
- needed when sending packages from one [[network]] to another that is using a different protocol
	→ not needed when sending data withing a network 
- is needed for connection [[router|routers]]

START
Basic
- what is a network [[gateway]]?
- What is the difference to a [[router]]?
- On which [[osi layers]] does it operate?
Back: 
- a [[gateway]] translates converts between [[osi layers#data link layer|data link layer]] network protocol
- a [[router]] is distributing packacges across networks
	→ a [[gateway]] connects networks ([[router]]) with different protocol's

#### data link layer
- phsical connection between nodes using e.g. data link [[switch|swiches]]
- makes sure the data get transmitted physicly to the right destination within a network
- works on [[media access code (MAC)]] level
