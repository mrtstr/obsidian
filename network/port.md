- number that uniquely identifys a local connection endpoint unter a given network adress
- while the [[internet protocol (IP)|IP adress]] is a (remote) identifier in a network the port is a virtual local identifier to reach different services under this adress
- ports are locally managed by the operating system of the nodes while the IP is relevant for the routing from node to node

- for [[transmission control protocol (TCP)|TCP]] and [[user datagram protocol (UDP)|UPD]] those ports are 16-bit unsigned number ranging from 0 to 65535
- port is opened or closed




### registered/user 0 to 1023
- reserved for the most commonly used services

Basic
- What is the difference between an [[internet protocol (IP)]] adress and a port?
- How are the concepts connected?
- What is identifiered by them?
Back: 
- while the [[internet protocol (IP)|IP adress]] is a (remote) identifier in a network the port is a virtual local identifier to reach different services under this adress
- ports are locally managed by the operating system of the nodes while the IP is relevant for the routing from node to node
