### localhost (loopback adress)
- special [[internet protocol (IP)]] adress block that is linking to the node itself
- the request will not leave the system and is processed in the system itself
#### [[ip V4]] loopback adress
- `127.0.0.0.1` will be resolved to the [[network domain]] `localhost`
```
127.0.0.0.1 <-> domain: localhost
127.0.0.0.0/8 <-> are all loopback adresses
```

#### [[ip V6]] loopback adress

```
0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001/128  <-> are all loopback adresses
