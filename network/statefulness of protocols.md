### statefulness of protocols
#### stateful [[protocol]]
- [[server]] and the [[client]] maintain information about the state of the connection e.g. sequence numbers, number of bytes sent/recived
- e.g [[transmission control protocol (TCP)]], [[li socket]]

#### stateless [[protocol]]
- each packet is treated as an independent unit of data and the server does not maintain any information about previous packets
- typically used for simple, one-time interactions
- e.g [[hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)]], [[internet protocol (IP)]]
